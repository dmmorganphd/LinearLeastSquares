# LinearLeastSquares
My treatment of the derivation of the linear algebraic formula for linear least squares approximation.

Draft drawing of the relationship between the column space of AA, bb, vv, and ee created in libreoffice in which AA is the matrix, bb is the solution to AA xx = bb and which is outside the column space of AA, vv = proj bb, and ee = bb - proj bb
